# SOLer Coaster
**Turning live hype into tokenized value with AI**

SOLer Coaster is a Solana-native initiative to transform real-time community momentum into programmable value. Our launch currency is Thrill Token ($THRL), introduced via a fair launch on pump.fun. Phase 1 establishes the documentation, alignment, and custody practices that lead into our creator-focused NFT platform and growth rails.

## Start here
- Read the [Whitepaper](whitepaper.md) — vision, ecosystem, technical overview, and risk.
- See the [Roadmap](roadmap.md) — phases and timeline context.
- Use the [$THRL Guide](token-thrl-guide.md) — how to verify, acquire, and use.

## Official updates and community
We announce official links only through our GitHub organization and this site. Always verify before interacting with contracts or tokens.
