- Project configuration, metadata standards, and distribution options
- Safety guides and verification tooling for creators and collectors

## Phase 3: Automation and Growth Rails

- Partner integrations across marketplaces and analytics

## Phase 4: Ecosystem Expansion
- Monetization features for creators and communities
