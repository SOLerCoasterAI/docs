# A Message from the SOLer Coaster Team

We built SOLer Coaster because creators and communities deserve tools that convert live momentum into lasting value—safely, transparently, and in the open. Thrill Token ($THRL) is our Phase 1 alignment mechanism: a fair-launched currency that signals participation and unlocks access as the ecosystem grows.

## What $THRL represents
- A simple on-ramp for early alignment
- A permissionless signal for participation and access
- A foundation for the upcoming creator-focused NFT engine and automation rails

## Our commitments
- Transparency: public docs, changelogs, and verification-first practices
- Focus: creator-first capabilities with pragmatic technical choices
- Consistency: iterative delivery with clear milestones

## Stay aligned
- Canonical site: https://solercoasterai.github.io/docs/
- Repository: https://github.com/solercoasterai/docs
- Community updates: always published and verified on the canonical site before anywhere else

Thank you for building with us. — The SOLer Coaster Team
