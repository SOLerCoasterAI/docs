# Governance and Participation

SOLer Coaster is committed to progressive decentralization and transparent decision-making. In early phases, we emphasize documentation, open communication, and non-binding signals that help us align the roadmap with community and creator needs.

## Principles
- Transparency over opacity: public docs, changelogs, and disclosures
- Participation over gatekeeping: clear ways to provide input and feedback
- Safety over speed: verification-first culture and incremental rollouts

## Planned Governance Signals
- Non-binding proposal discussions and signal votes in early phases
- Public RFCs for significant product and ecosystem decisions
- Evolution toward stronger on-chain governance as the ecosystem matures

## Treasury and Disclosures (Future)
- Any treasury constructs will be documented with public visibility and periodic disclosures
- Clear policies for spend, grants, and accountability

## How to Participate
- Follow and verify updates on the canonical site: https://solercoasterai.github.io/docs/
- Contribute feedback via GitHub issues and public RFCs when available
- Engage constructively in community channels referenced on the site
